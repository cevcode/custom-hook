Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Node -v `v10.16.0`

## How to test?
Custom react hook is placed in `src/useArbitraryStateHook`.<br>
Also I created view module on `App.tsx` where you can see example how it works.


## Available Scripts
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
